## Aim

My aim create a clean, concise portfolio page that shows my personality and my aesthetics. I wanted to demonstrate my appreciation for
interesting design concepts 

### Hello
I thought of this portfolio site more as an extension of myself, so wanted to make my introduction a little more casual. I did this by
using the title "Hello" instead of "About" and also created a handwritten animation. In my design and content, I have tried to incorporate
my interests in calligraphy/typography and science as well as a little bit of humour.

### Projects


### Thoughts


### Contact
This is a call to action so again, I wanted to make this section more personal by adding some handwritten text.

## Design process
I researched ideas mainly using Pinterest and searching for minimalist websites through Google for inspiration. 
I had a fairly clear idea of the overall look of the site: clean and light with strong typographical elements and colour blocks. 
I wanted to use my own images and was lucky in that I already had useable photos. The main sakura image then informed the colour palette
for the website.

Next I used figma to create a mock up of the website, both for mobile and desktop. This process was the most fun given that there were no constraints. However, this did prove challenging later on, as I had created the designs without much awareness of the html structure and css styling that would be required.
