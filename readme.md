## Aim

My aim was to create a clean, concise portfolio page that shows my personality and my aesthetics. 
I wanted to demonstrate my appreciation for interesting design concepts, as well as challenge myself to create the page using CSS

### Hello
I thought of this portfolio site more as an extension of myself, so wanted to make my introduction a little more casual. I did this by
using the title "Hello" instead of "About" and also created a handwritten animation. In my design and content, I have tried to incorporate
my interests in calligraphy/typography and science as well as a little bit of humour.

### Projects


### Thoughts


### Contact
This is a call to action so again, I wanted to make this section more personal by adding some handwritten text.

## Design process
I researched ideas mainly using Pinterest and searching for minimalist websites through Google for inspiration. 
I had a fairly clear idea of the overall look of the site: clean and light with strong typographical elements and colour blocks. 
I wanted to use my own images and was lucky in that I already had useable photos. The main sakura image then informed the colour palette
for the website.

Next I used figma to create a mock up of the website, both for mobile and desktop. This process was the most fun given that there were no constraints. However, this did prove challenging later on, as I had created the designs without much awareness of the html structure and css styling that would be required.

## Lessons Learnt
Initially, the excitement of the design process caused me to attempt to code a website that was outside my capability and scope, given that I was not looking at using any frameworks.

By examining the mess I was making, I was able to take a step back and simplify the overall design, both from a HTML structure and a style perspective, while retaining the overall look and feel I was aiming for. By reducing the struggle with the layout and positioning, I was also then able to research and incorporate other small features (such as parallax scrolling and animations) more easily.
