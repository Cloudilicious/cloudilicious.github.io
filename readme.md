## Aim

My aim was to create a clean, concise portfolio page that shows my personality and my aesthetics. 
I wanted to demonstrate my appreciation for interesting design concepts, as well as challenge myself to create the page using CSS

### Hello
I thought of this portfolio site more as an extension of myself, so wanted to make my introduction a little more casual. I did this by
using the title "Hello" instead of "About" and also created a handwritten animation. In my design and content, I have tried to incorporate
my interests in calligraphy/typography and science as well as a little bit of humour.

### Projects
I wanted this section to be clear and concise so there isn't any special formatting here. 
An appropriately selected image helps draw the viewer to the content.

### Thoughts
Again, this is an area that I wanted to keep quite simple as it could potentially end up with lots of links and text. 
I added a round image just to change things up a bit.

### Contact
I wanted to make this section more personal by adding some handwritten text, so the viewer feels invited to contact me

## Design process
I researched ideas mainly using Pinterest and searching for minimalist websites through Google for inspiration. 
I had a fairly clear idea of the overall look of the site: clean and light with strong typographical elements and colour blocks. 
I wanted to use my own images and was lucky in that I already had useable photos. The main sakura image then informed the colour palette
for the website.

Next I used figma to create a mock up of the website, both for mobile and desktop. This process was the most fun given that there were no constraints. However, this did prove challenging later on, as I had created the designs without much awareness of the html structure and css styling that would be required.

## Building

I only used HTML and CSS to build my website

### Meta tags

I add `description`, `keywords` and `author` as well as some og tags for title, type, description and image. I tested this using the Facebook developer tool and it was pretty neat.

### CSS

I attempted to write my code as mobile first although my main aim was really to just have a working website! I attempted to use media queries but was unable to wield this power, possibly because of my html structure and also the fact that I wasn't using bootstrap.

### Images & Icons

I used my own images in .jpg format, which complemented the colour palette and was also in keeping with my profile photo. I believe this creates a very strong theme although it's possible some people may mistake the website for a travel website or some sort of self-serving homage to the colour pink.

I also created handwritten text as .svg files, which not only preserves the image regardless of the image size, it also allowed me to add some animation. I think the simple monoline text also contrasts well with the multiple colours used throughout the website and the detailed background images.

I steered away from using icons and focussed on text only, especially on my contacts page where one would expect icons, as I liked the subtle reference to 'old school' files and documentation with my font choice. I may review this in the future. In any case, I would create my own icons to match the handwritten elements of the design.

## Lessons Learnt
Initially, the excitement of the design process caused me to attempt to code a website that was outside my capability and scope, given that I was not looking at using any frameworks.

By examining the mess I was making, I was able to take a step back and simplify the overall design, both from a HTML structure and a style perspective, while retaining the overall look and feel I was aiming for. By reducing the struggle with the layout and positioning, I was also then able to research and incorporate other small features (such as parallax scrolling and animations) more easily.

## Improvements
- Responsiveness and media queries
- Enhanced scrolling capability
- Layout and positioning for future-proofing - such as when adding more projects or blog posts to the Projects and Thoughts sections respectively
